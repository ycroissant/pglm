abstract = {This paper investigates the methodological problems associated with the use of housing market data to measure the willingness to pay for clean air. With the use of a hedonic housing price model and data for the Boston metropolitan area, quantitative estimates of the willingness to pay for air quality improvements are generated. Marginal air pollution damages (as revealed in the housing market) are found to increase with the level of air pollution and with household income. The results are relatively sensitive to the specification of the hedonic housing price equation, but insensitive to the specification of the air quality demand equation.}

abstract = {We contrast the two-part model (TPM) that distinguishes between users and non-users of health care, with a latent class model (LCM) that distinguishes between infrequent and frequent users. In model comparisons using data on counts of utilization from the RAND Health Insurance Experiment (RHIE), we find strong evidence in favor of the LCM. We show that individuals in the infrequent and frequent user latent classes may be described as being healthy and ill, respectively. Although sample averages of price elasticities, conditional means and event probabilities are not statistically different, the estimates of these policy-relevant measures are substantively different when calculated for hypothetical individuals with specific characteristics.}

 abstract = {We estimate how cost sharing, the portion of the bill the patient pays, affects the demand for medical services. The data come from a randomized experiment. A catastrophic insurance plan reduces expenditures 31 percent relative to zero out-of-pocket price. The price elasticity is approximately -0.2. We reject the hypothesis that less favorable coverage of outpatient services increases total expenditure (for example, by deterring preventive care or inducing hospitalization).},

 abstract = {The perceived fairness of different rules for allocating scarce resources is analysed in two cases: seats on a high speed train and parking spaces in a company car park. Attitudes toward allocation rules depend on context. They vary according to: the educational level of respondents; the type of "good"; and the exceptional or recurring nature of scarcity. Peak pricing, administrative and lottery rules are seen as the most unfair, together with queuing in some cases. The moral rule is considered to be the fairest one, except by more educated people who prefer the compensation rule.},

 abstract = {We estimate the union premium for young men over a period of declining unionization (1980-87) through a procedure which identifies the alternative sources of the endogeneity of union status. While we estimate the average increase in wages resulting from union employment to be in excess of 20% we find that the return to unobserved heterogeneity operating through union status is substantial and that the union premium is highly variable. We also find that the premium is sensitive to the form of sorting allowed in estimation. Moreover, the data are consistent with comparative advantage sorting. Our results suggest that the unobserved heterogeneity which positively contributes to the likelihood of union membership is associated with higher wages. We are unable, however, to determine whether this is due to the ability of these workers to extract monopoly rents or whether it reflects the more demanding hiring standards of employers faced by union wages.},

 abstract = {Previous work on the preferred specification of hedonic price models usually recommended a Box-Cox model. In this paper we note that any parametric model involves implicit restrictions and they can be reduced by using a semiparametric model. We estimate a benchmark parametric model which passes several common specification tests, before showing that a semiparametric model outperforms it significantly. In addition to estimating the model, we compare the predictions of the models by deriving the distribution of the predicted log(price) and then calculating the associated prediction intervals. Our data show that the semiparametric model provides more accurate mean predictions than the benchmark parametric model.},

The data collected for this purpose show that minorities are more than twice as likely to be denied a mortgage as whites. Yet variables correlated with both race and creditworthiness were omitted from these data, making any conclusion about race's role in mortgage lending impossible. The Federal Reserve Bank of Boston collected additional variables important to the mortgage lending decision and found that race continued to play an important, though significantly diminished, role in the decision to grant a mortgage.},
